# Lasergraph DSP timecode importer
Timecode importer for the Laseranimation Sollinger Lasergraph DSP.

## Description
This tool imports timestamps from a csv-file to the LaserAnimation Sollinger Lasergraph DSP timescript and adds the corresponding entries.<br>

## Why?
Sometimes it's hard to find the correct timestamp for specific (out of beat) sequences in the Lasergraph DSP Timescript.<br>
There are thrid party tools like Reaper, where you can set specific markers to the the timeline and export them afterwards to a csv-file.<br>
For light shows with the MaLighting GrandMa2, it is common practice to use the exported csv and import it to the consol.<br>
<br>
I want to adapt this workflow to the Lasergraph DSP.
